# 🌊 Power Generation from Tidal/Water Motion using Magnetic Induction

This project demonstrates the use of **electromagnetic induction** to generate clean, renewable energy from tidal or wave motion. We designed a dual-method prototype — coil suspension and underwater coil — to harness the kinetic energy of moving water and convert it into usable electricity.

> Developed as part of the Experiential Learning Program at **RV College of Engineering**, Bengaluru (2023–24)

## ⚙️ Techniques Used

| Method               | Description                                                                 |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Coil Suspension       | A buoyant tube with magnets oscillates through a suspended coil.            |
| Underwater Coil       | Submerged coil with magnets in a floating body generates voltage via waves. |

> Both systems rely on wave-induced motion to move magnets through a coil, creating an alternating magnetic field and inducing current.

## 📐 Working Principle

> Based on **Faraday’s Law of Electromagnetic Induction**  
When magnets move through a coil (or vice versa), the changing magnetic field induces a voltage across the coil terminals. Repeating this motion through wave activity allows continuous energy harvesting.
